# Data-Visualization-MCIT-NanoDegree
This repository contains the projects submitted as a part of the NanoDegree program, which was awarded as a scholarship by SDA-RISE program for the 'Data Visualization - MCIT' course
### **Data Visualization Nanodegree program**

This Data Visualization Nanodegree program covers four courses on data visualization and storytelling. Students will learn to select appropriate visualizations, design effective dashboards, and tell data stories that uncover insights and make recommendations. They will use Tableau to build interactive dashboards and create polished presentations with data visualizations. Through a series of projects, students will learn to discover user needs, identify key metrics, prototype, and design dashboards, analyze data to find insights, and communicate recommendations effectively.

### **Project 1: Build a Data Visualization project**

- In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to combine a lot of what you’ve learned throughout this entire program. This project may seem challenging and there isn’t a lot of guidance provided, as we want you to have the freedom to be creative. That dataset that you are working with is real and it is pretty big. When you are an analyst for a company, there often isn’t guidance as to how to correctly answer a particular question. And there might not be one right answer. Leverage your skills. Make sure you look through the directions carefully.

- In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

### **Project 2: Design a Data Dashboard Midterm Project**

- A startup called Sales_Rocket wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on their sales across the nation. Management has a few questions they’d like easy access to. Currently, they answer these questions through spreadsheets scattered about and a variety of different tools. Unfortunately, none of the spreadsheets and tools neatly combine all their answers into one.

- They would like a dashboard designer to go through each question and try to come up with a way to display their data in a way that is neat and intuitive, even for the less data-savvy among them.

- In this project, you will apply what you have learned about designing with your audience in mind to build a useful dashboard prototype. To complete the project, you will need to create a prototype that allows users to intuitively answer the series of questions below. You can use any modern dashboarding tool you would like. You are free to use Tableau. For this project, you will be using the __Superstore dataset. __

### **Project 3: Design a Data Dashboard Final Project**

- In this project, you will incorporate the new skills you have learned around the dashboard designed to grab your audience’s attention. We will be emphasizing key elements of the dashboard that continue acknowledging the audience's level of graphicacy, conscious management of color to avoid confusion, and our innate ability to identify patterns so those who find your dashboard are drawn to the key points.

- PowerBI Tutorials [Optional Tool Choice]: If you choose to use PowerBI, and need some additional help navigating Power BI and getting your visualizations set up, there is guidance available on the Microsoft website.

- Tableau Tutorials [Optional Tool Choice]: If you choose to use Tableau, and need some additional help navigating Tableau and getting your visualizations set up, the Tableau website offers training videos and tutorials that can guide you through the process.

### **Project 4: Build a Data Story Midterm Project*

- You are a data science consultant for a large production company, Spectacular Studios. They have been collecting data on the merits of thousands of movies that have come out in the past several years and the respective audience responses. The studio is unsure what to do with the data they have and has asked you to come on board to provide insights on what they can take away from this data set. Your job is to provide the executive team with insights into a problem that matters to them.

- Your role is to define the problem that is compelling enough for the executive team to warrant taking action. From there, your role is to develop the storyline of what you can expect the data to tell you from your analysis.

- In this project, you will apply the skills you have learned in structuring a data story. You will be provided with a Movies Metadata CSV and will have the ability to define your own problem statement, the analyses you would conduct to solve the objective, and outline a set of potential solutions/actionable next steps for the target audience.

### **Project 5: Build a Data Story Final Project*

- You are continuing your work for Spectacular Studios. The executive team would like for you to walk through your recommendations and risks to the analysis that might affect your proposed action items. Your job is to provide their team with the final presentation, including an executive summary of key next steps.

- Your role will be to develop a final presentation that is roughly 10-15 slides and provide a detailed analysis that digs into potential limitations and biases of the dataset you’re working with.

- You will now bring together all you have learned about data storytelling by combining the ghost deck and their analyses to provide a final recommendation. You will also need to identify the limitations and biases in data that affect the recommendations you provide.

- You will continue to use the same Movies Metadata CSV and conduct the EDA necessary to understand the dataset as a whole. The expected output will be to surface if the dataset is balanced if there are anomalies in the dataset that affect the applicability of the recommendation, and the final presentation itself that will be used for a mock recommendation to a management team.

- Datasets: For this project, you’ll be working with a choice of datasets. The description above relies on the Metadata_Movies.csv.

### **Project 6:Animate a Data Story Midterm Project**

- You are an analyst for The World Bank. You are conducting research for the World Bank on historical global trends to better understand the current situation and how things have developed in different countries and regions around the world.

- Your manager has tasked you with conducting data analysis on a world indicators data set to find and tell a data story at a conference for global development nonprofits. You are given access to historical data going back to 1990 on a variety of country-level attributes related to energy usage, the impact on the environment, and the economy.

- In this project, you'll build on your previously developed skills of creating charts, graphs, maps and dashboards in Tableau, and apply what you've learned in the lessons on creating stories. You will use the Tableau Story Points feature and the seven data story types in order to find, create, and tell a coherent data story to your audience.

### **Project 7:Animate a Data Story Final Project**

- You are continuing your work as an analyst for the World Bank, understanding trends in global development by country and year. You have successfully created an interactive data story in your first project, and now your manager has asked you to take it to another level for a presentation in the auditorium.

- Your goal of this next phase of the project is to create an animated bubble chart, make a story out of it, and add audio to narrate the story. You will be using the same dataset from the mid-term project energy_environment_economy.csv to build out your narrated story in Flourish.


### **Project 8: Data Visualization Capstone Project**

- he purpose of the data visualization capstone project is to give you a chance to combine what you've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of your portfolio that will help you achieve your career goals in data visualization. __You will be writing a blog to describe how you would improve an existing visualization. __

**What you will create?**

- In this project, you goal is to choose a dataset or visualization from [MakeoverMonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) that you believe you can improve by creating a different dashboard/ data presentation or animated story. You will create a blog that includes your reflection on what improvements you made to the existing visualization, and you will include links to your new improved visualization.

- You get to define the scope and data for a project of your own design. Once you have decided which dataset or visualization to work with, complete the following steps.

**Project Requirements**

1. Your blog should include a link to the original visualization along with a citation for the original data source.
2. In your blog, please clearly indicate whether you are providing a new dashboard, data presentation slides or an animated story.
3. Please include a link to your dashboard/ presentations (It is OK to include screenshots of the slides) or an animated story.
